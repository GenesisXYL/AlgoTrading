    "# Debug: update quantity_behind after placing order aggressively\n",
    "Set tick factor coefficient to 1. Add some logs to the algo_loop, we find that at bar $9$, after placing order aggressively, the quantity_behind will not update, which causes the endless aggressive trading until the total shares are sold out. Thus, we add a line to update the quantity_behind to eliminate the bug.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the class, professor set the tick factor to 0 and displayed that it would perfectly follow the VWAP. The reason is if we ignore the tick factor, we will never place order aggressively in our loop (the fair value is always above bid_price), given the specific TSLA TAQ data set.\n",
    "# Exact number of shares traded\n",
    "After fixing bug, the total shares traded is slightly less than our target $30000$. The reason is at the last bar we trade passively, and our orders are not guaranteed to be fufilled. In order to finish all the orders, at the last bar, we force it to trade aggressively, which achieve our target more precisely but slightly increase the trading cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing that prevents us from trading exact $30000$ shares is that we can only trade mutiple of 100 shares when trading aggressively (round_lot=100). We can not change this because it's determined by the exchange. "
